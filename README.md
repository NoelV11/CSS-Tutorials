In this repository,I have provided source code to perform and implement divsion styling,application of styling to videos and text decoration.If designing a website is an obstacle,CSS is your answer

I will demonstrate the Kids Alphabet Chart (Kids Alphabet chart.html).In this styling,an alphabet chart is provided to the viewer.If the viewer wants to learn more about the alphabet,then it will redirect the page to a word,starting with that particular alphabet
